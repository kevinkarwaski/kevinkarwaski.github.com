<p>At the AWS Summit, Vogels just took the stage. The persentation contains much of what we saw at AWS Re:Invent.</p>

<p>Then:
* 7 years ago, launched S3.</p>

<p>Now:
* 33 major services
* AWS Marketplace - Pre-packaged software (25 categories / 778 products)
* 31 Price Reductions since 2006! (Benefits of economies of scale)
* AWS Trusted Advisor - Saved customers $22M last year</p>

<p>Pace of innovation is the differentiator.
53 New Services announcements in Q1 2013.</p>

<p>Services:
S3: 2T Objects; 1.1M peak reqs/sec
EMR: 5.5M clusters launched since 5/10
DynamoDB: Now announcing Local Secondary Indexes.</p>

<p>DB always bottleneck in scaling.</p>

<p>Transformation:
What Drives it?
* Success of CC: Addresses uncertainty - on demand, only use when needed, pay only for what you use, leverage core competencies, turn fixed cost into variable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trade capital expense for variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce TCO. 70% reduced over 5 years. (Foursquare 50% reduction in analytics costs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticity.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase innovation by reducing the cost of failure. exp often / fail quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop spending money on Undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Go global in minutes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Evolution of connectivity</p>

<p>Phase 1: People to people
Phase 2: Assets to assets via AI (trillions of assets)</p>

<p>Innovation limited by speed... Crowd Driven Ecosytem for Evolutionary Design. (CEED)</p>

<p>Orchastrates distrbuted workflows; collaborative Federated env... first commercial use of GovCloud.</p>

<p>Gene Sequencing: illunia
DNA sequencing... streams up to S3 for data analysis. BaseSpace (https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index)</p>

<p>1000 Genomes Project: 250TB available in S3</p>

<p>Hospitality: Customer Service</p>

increase workforce mobility</p>

<p>Security and Privacy:
readily avail encryption services

<p>Case study: EasyBib</p>

<ul>
<li>Info literacy company</li>
<li>different envs (dev)</li>
</ul>


<p>Higher Level Services:
Beanstalk / Opsworks</p>

<p>DIY:
Cloudformation / EC2</p>

<p>=====================================</p>

<p>Disaster Recovery in the Cloud</p>

<p>"The mind is not a vesel to be filled, but a fire to ignite."</p>

<p>BC
High A -> backup storage -> disaster recovery</p>

<p>Monastery and Indoctrination have correlaries.</p>

<p>Lessons from Montecassino:
* Backup should be accessable
* Backup should be scalable
* Backup should be safe
* Should work with DR policy
* Someone should care about it</p>

<p>Case Study: Shaw Media
Reach 20M+ canadians / week</p>

<p>1M files would lose 1 file every 100K years... eleven 9s of durability.</p>

<p>Test the god damn disaster recovery plan. "CloudFormer" to create Cloud Formation templates.</p>
