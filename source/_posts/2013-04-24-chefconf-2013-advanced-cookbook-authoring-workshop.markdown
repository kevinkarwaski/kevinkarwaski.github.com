Wednesday Workshops:

Test-Driven Development for Chef Cookbooks with Bershelf and Vagrant

by Julian Dunn

First time doing the workshop. 10 years as sysadmin.

People are here from: Adobe, Goldman Sachs, Accenture, Montreal Daily Newspaper, Apple, Ars Technica

Infra testing / automation / dev is the same as software dev was in 1995. Ops aspires to better.

Three things are nessesary to test the cookbook:

 - A place to store the artifact
 - chef-client with access
 - a target server running same OS as prod
 
 Artifact, Source Code, 
 
 Chefspec tests input / instantiaion of chef components; minitest-handler tests output.
